# Blunder

## Todo
- We're currently bundling two instances of typescript. See if we can import the one used by the monaco-editor (`node_modules\monaco-editor\esm\vs\language\typescript\lib`).
- Chessbored not published yet, so remember to `npm link chessbored`.
- The craco hook should be documented.
